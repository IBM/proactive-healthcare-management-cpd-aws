# Proactive healthcare management system with AWS Kinesis Streams and IBM Cloud Pak for Data

In the healthcare domain, there is a lot of real-time data that is generated. This real-time data needs to be monitored to generate predictions and alerts for healthcare professionals. A manual monitoring of such data is difficult. Hence in this code pattern we add AI based predictions and automate the monitoring of healthcare data. To demonstrate IBM Cloud pak for Data technology on AWS Cloud, we have taken the use case of predicting cardiac events based on real-time monitoring of patients health data.

In this code pattern, you will learn to build a machine learning model with no code on IBM Cloud Pak for Data, create a streaming flow on AWS Cloud and invoke the model to get predictions in real-time.

IBM Services used in the code pattern:
* IBM Cloud Pak for Data
  * Watson Studio
  * Watson Guided ML (Modeler Flow)
  * Watson Machine Learning

AWS Services used in the code pattern:
* AWS IAM Roles
* Amazon Kinesis
* AWS Lambda Functions
* Amazon CloudWatch
* Amazon S3

Anyone using AWS services will be able to seamlessly plug in the IBM Cloud pak for Data Watson Machine Learning model to their flow.

Once you complete the code pattern, you will learn to:

* Create a S3 bucket on AWS.
* Create an event notification for the S3 bucket to trigger functions on adding data to the bucket.
* Create IAM Roles to AWS Services.
* Create a Lambda producer function to encrypt the data from S3 bucket and send it to Amazon Kinesis.
* Create a Machine Learning model using Guided ML (Modeler Flow) on IBM Cloud Pak for Data.
* Deploy the Machine Learning model on IBM Cloud Pak for Data Watson Machine learning and get the APIs to Invoke the model.
* Create a Lambda consumer function to decrypt the streaming data from Amazon Kinesis and send it to the model to get predictions.
* View the real-time predections from IBM Cloud Pak for Data Watson Machine Learning in Amazon CloudWatch.

## Flow

1. Healthcare data is dumped into a S3 bucket on AWS.
1. A producer lambda function is triggered to encrypt the data and stream it to AWS Kinesis.
1. A machine learning model is trained in IBM Cloud pak for Data Watson Studio using Guided ML (Modeler Flow) and the model is deployed in Watson Studio Machine Learning.
1. A consumer lambda function reads the data from kinesis streams.
1. The consumer function invokes the model from Watson Studio Machine Learning with the data received from kinesis streams.
1. The data streamed from the kinesis along with the predictions received from the Watson Studio Machine Learning are then visualized in AWS CloudWatch.

## 8. Upload data to s3 bucket

This step is to simulate data dumps coming into your s3 bucket and the Machine Learning model gives predictions. You can connect your s3 bucket with any service that can dump data into the bucket to trigger the event notification.

* Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/>
   * In the Buckets list, choose the name of the bucket that you created.
   * Click on **Upload** and click on **Add files** and select the [test-file.csv](data/test-file.csv) and click on **Upload**.
      >Note: We have taken random 6 rows from the `X_Test.csv` and created the `test-file.csv`.

Now that the data is added into the bucket, the event trigger will invoke the producer function and the function will send the data from the file to Kinesis. Kinesis will stream the data. Consumer function will comsume the streaming data and invoke the Machine Learning model deployed on IBM Cloud Pak for Data. The Model will send the output and the confidence score. All this happens in realtime.

## 9. View Logs in CloudWatch

Follow the steps to view the predeictions in real-time,

* Open the [Functions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/functions) on the Lambda console.
* Select the `Consumer` function that you created earlier.
* Under the **Monitor** tab, click on **View logs in CloudWatch**. This will launch **Amazon CloudWatch** in a new tab.
* In the **CloudWatch** dashboard, under **Log streams** you will see logs for your consumer function. Select the latest entry to view the logs.

## Summary

In this code pattern, you learnt how to build a machine learning model with no code using Guided ML (Modeler Flow) on IBM Cloud Pak for Data, create a streaming flow using Amazon Kinesis on AWS Cloud and invoke the model using AWS Lambda function to get predictions and view in real-time on Amazon CloudWatch.

## Future scope
This code pattern can be further extended by visualizing the results using IBM Cloud Pak for Data Embedded Dashboard.
